## TL; DR

```bash
$ pip install signalhooks
```

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import SNSSignalHook, HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


# SNS hooks
sns_hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic")
post_save.connect(sns_hook, sender=Pizza)


# HTTP(S) hooks
http_hook = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-other-microservice.app/api/v1/callback")
post_save.connect(http_hook, sender=Pizza)
```

ðŸŽ‰ Start receiving notifications!

## The problem

Microservice architectures are great, but keeping services syncronized about distributed events can be very challenging.

Sample use case:
```
When "Model X" is created in "Service 1", update "Model Y" attributes in "Service 2".
```

In a monolithic app this use case would be very simple to solve, but in distributed architectures it gets a little more complicated. `Service 2` needs to be notified when a new instance of `Model X` is created, and needs to receive the new instance attributes (fields in the Model) in order to perform its actions.

A more complex use case:
```
When "Model X" is deleted in "Service 1", do "X" in "Service 2" and "Y" in "Service 3".
```

Many subscribers might be interested in listeting when `Model X` instances get updated/deleted. And all services might be interested in receiving the instance attributes/ID to react accordingly.

## Solution
`django-signalhooks` provides a set of useful hooks that you can attach to your Django Signals to notify other services when a Signal is triggered.
All you need to do is connect the [Django Signal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/signals/) you want with the hook that better fits your needs.

## Supported hooks

Currently, these are the supported hooks:

* `SNSSignalHook`: Publishes a message to a AWS SNS Topic each time a Signal is triggered.

* `HTTPSignalHook`: Performs a HTTP(S) webhook request each time a Signal is trigerred.

* Any other idea? [Create an issue](https://github.com/martinzugnoni/django-signalhooks/issues/new).

### SNSSignalHook

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1155573/84656610-541cad80-aee9-11ea-96c4-50c19d83be01.png)

[Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) (SNS) is a great option to keep your microservices syncronized. It's a pubsub solution where one service can publish notifications to a "topic", and any other services can subscribe to receive those notifications.

`SNSSignalHook` let you send a SNS Notification to certain Topic when a Django Signal is triggered. If the Signal is an instance of [ModelSignal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/signals/#module-django.db.models.signals), the SNS notification will serialize the sender instance as JSON and send it in the notification payload as `base64` encoded.

#### How to use it

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import SNSSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic"
)
post_save.connect(hook, sender=Pizza)
```

Make sure you configure your target services as subscribers of the SNS Topic you connected the Signal to.

#### Sample SNS notification body

The notification published to SNS will look similar to this:

```python
sns_client.publish(
    TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic",
    Message="Django Signal triggered",
    MessageAttributes={
        "Event": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "myapp.Pizza:created",
        },
        "InstanceId": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "25",
        },
        "Instance": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "eyJtb2RlbCI6ICJhcHAucGl6emEiLCAicGsiOiAyNCwgImZpZWxkcyI6IHsibmFtZSI6ICJOYXBvbGl0YW5hIiwgInByaWNlIjogIjEwLjUwIn19",
        },
    },
)
```

Note that `"Instance"` is a JSON serialization of your `Pizza` model, encoded as `base64` to allow transportation in a JSON payload.

### New Nested Json Serializer

Note: This feature is available since `v0.1.4` and only for SNSSignalHooks

The default json serializer serializes the primary key or natural keys for ForeingKey or ManyToMany relationships. 
This is not helpful if we need to know additional information about the nested fields. 
Now we have a new Nested Serializer to do this job.

We have three new initial parameters: 
* `serializer`: receives the serializer to use, `json` by default
* `nested_fields`: an array of nested fields to be serialized. They could be at any nested level.
* `max_depth`: object nesting level needed. 

If nested_fields or max_depth are missing, it will behave like default serializer.

### Serializer registration

The first thing we need to do is register as a serializer.

```python
from django.core.serializers import register_serializer

register_serializer("json.nested", "signalhooks.serializer.nested")
```

Now we are ready to initialize the SNSSignalHook.


### Examples 

Suppose that a model `C` is an attribute of model `B` with model `B` being an attribute of `A`.

```python
sns_hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:0123456789:your-topic",
    serializer="json.nested",
    nested_fields=["b"],
    max_depth=1,
)
```
This config will serialize all the non Primary Key or M2M attributes of  `b` and the primary key of `c` 

If we do

```python
sns_hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:0123456789:your-topic",
    serializer="json.nested",
    nested_fields=["b", "c"],
    max_depth=2,
)
```
This config will serialize all the non Primary Key or M2M attributes of  `b` and the non PK or m2m attributes of `c` 

### HTTPSignalHook

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1155573/84656657-6a2a6e00-aee9-11ea-8722-b30f0504cdf4.png)

Performs a HTTP(S) webhook request to given URL each time the Signal is triggered.

#### How to use it

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


hook = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-other-service.app/hook-callback",
    request_method="POST"
)
post_save.connect(hook, sender=Pizza)
```

#### Connect to multiple services

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza

# Service 1
hook_service1 = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-service-1.app/hook-callback")
post_save.connect(hook_service1, sender=Pizza)

# Service 2
hook_service2 = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-service-2.app/hook-callback")
post_save.connect(hook_service2, sender=Pizza)
```

Each time the `Pizza` models is saved, both `Service 1` and `Service 2` will get notified.
