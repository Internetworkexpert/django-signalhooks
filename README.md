# django-signalhooks

## TL; DR

```bash
$ pip install signalhooks
```

```python
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import SNSSignalHook, HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


# SNS hooks
sns_hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic")
post_save.connect(sns_hook, sender=Pizza)


# HTTP(S) hooks
http_hook = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-other-microservice.app/api/v1/callback")
post_save.connect(http_hook, sender=Pizza)
```

## The problem

Microservice architectures are great, but keeping services syncronized about distributed events can be very challenging.

Sample use case:
```
When "Model X" is created in "Service 1", update "Model Y" attributes in "Service 2".
```

In a monolithic app this use case would be very simple to solve, but in distributed architectures it gets a little more complicated. `Service 2` needs to be notified when a new instance of `Model X` is created, and needs to receive the new instance attributes (fields in the Model) in order to perform its actions.

A more complex use case:
```
When "Model X" is deleted in "Service 1", do "X" in "Service 2" and "Y" in "Service 3".
```

Many subscribers might be interested in listeting when `Model X` instances get updated/deleted. And all services might be interested in receiving the instance attributes/ID to react accordingly.

## Solution
`django-signalhooks` provides a set of useful hooks that you can attach to your Django Signals to notify other services when a Signal is triggered.
All you need to do is connect the [Django Signal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/signals/) you want with the hook that better fits your needs.

## Supported hooks

Currently, these are the supported hooks:

* `SNSSignalHook`: Publishes a message to a AWS SNS Topic each time a Signal is triggered.

* `HTTPSignalHook`: Performs a HTTP(S) webhook request each time a Signal is trigerred.

* Any other idea? [Create an issue](https://github.com/martinzugnoni/django-signalhooks/issues/new).

### SNSSignalHook

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1155573/84656610-541cad80-aee9-11ea-96c4-50c19d83be01.png)

[Amazon Simple Notification Service](https://aws.amazon.com/sns) (SNS) is a great option to keep your microservices syncronized. It's a pubsub solution where one service can publish notifications to a "topic", and any other services can subscribe to receive those notifications.

`SNSSignalHook` let you send a SNS Notification to certain Topic when a Django Signal is triggered. If the Signal is an instance of [ModelSignal](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/signals/#module-django.db.models.signals), the SNS notification will serialize the sender instance as JSON and send it in the notification payload as `base64` encoded.

#### How to use it

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import SNSSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


hook = SNSSignalHook(
    sns_topic_arn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic"
)
post_save.connect(hook, sender=Pizza)
```

Make sure you configure your target services as subscribers of the SNS Topic you connected the Signal to.

#### Sample SNS notification body

The notification published to SNS will look similar to this:

```python
sns_client.publish(
    TopicArn="arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:585698547586:your-topic",
    Message="Django Signal triggered",
    MessageAttributes={
        "Event": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "myapp.Pizza:created",
        },
        "InstanceId": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "25",
        },
        "Instance": {
            "DataType": "String",
            "StringValue": "eyJtb2RlbCI6ICJhcHAucGl6emEiLCAicGsiOiAyNCwgImZpZWxkcyI6IHsibmFtZSI6ICJOYXBvbGl0YW5hIiwgInByaWNlIjogIjEwLjUwIn19",
        },
    },
)
```

Note that `"Instance"` is a JSON serialization of your `Pizza` model, encoded as `base64` to allow transportation in a JSON payload.


### HTTPSignalHook

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1155573/84656657-6a2a6e00-aee9-11ea-8722-b30f0504cdf4.png)

Performs a HTTP(S) webhook request to given URL each time the Signal is triggered.

#### How to use it

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza


hook = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-other-service.app/hook-callback",
    request_method="POST"
)
post_save.connect(hook, sender=Pizza)
```

#### Connect to multiple services

```python
# signals.py

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from signalhooks.hooks import HTTPSignalHook

from myapp.models import Pizza

# Service 1
hook_service1 = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-service-1.app/hook-callback")
post_save.connect(hook_service1, sender=Pizza)

# Service 2
hook_service2 = HTTPSignalHook(
    request_url="https://my-service-2.app/hook-callback")
post_save.connect(hook_service2, sender=Pizza)
```

Each time the `Pizza` models is saved, both `Service 1` and `Service 2` will get notified.
